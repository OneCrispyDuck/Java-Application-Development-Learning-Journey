# Method Overloading Exercise

## Objective
Create a Shape class that demonstrates method overloading by calculating areas of different shapes.

## Requirements
1. Implement three overloaded calculateArea methods:
   - Calculate circle area (one parameter)
   - Calculate rectangle area (two parameters)
   - Calculate triangle area (three parameters)

## Expected Output
- Circle area with radius 5
- Rectangle area with length 4 and width 6
- Triangle area with sides 3, 4, and 5

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correct implementation of overloaded methods
- Proper parameter handling
- Accurate calculations
